3. Controls
==========================
To successfully run the program and play, two NES controllers are necessary. Feel free to contact us for a demonstration.

1. Press the start button to advance from the Title Screen into the Character Select Screen
2. Each player selects their character by using the D-pad to move the selection box. Press A to lock-in and press A again
if you want to cancel your lock-in and choose a different character. Once both players have selected their characters, the
map select screen appears.
3. Either player can choose from the two maps and cause the program to advance. Press start to confirm a map selection. 
4.  All characters move with the D-pad. The left and right are standard directional buttons. The up button performs a jump,
pressing up two-times consecutively will result in a double jump. Certain characters have aerial specials, perform them by
pressing A during a double jump. Pressing down will result in a fast-fall. Pressing down and b in the air will produce a 
special down attack. Characters can shoot and attack while running.

->Each character has unique gameplay:
	Megaman
		* Increased movement speed and movement versatility
		* A: Sword attack
		* B: Buster Shot
		* Pressing Down and B in the air: Fast fall stomp
		* Pressing A during a double jump: Performs a spin move
		  that increases Megaman's velocity during the duration
	Big Smoke
		* High rate of bullet fire due to his Tec9
		* A: Swing bat
		* B: Shoot in rapid-fire from Tec9
	Fire Bat
		* Medium range
		* Fire attack
		* A: Spray Fire
		* B: Use stim pack, which provides a boost in speed 
		  and damage but then leads to a resting, immobile period
	Leprechaun
		* Unique projectiles
		* Doesn't flinch because he's a Leprechaun (i.e. doesn't recoil)
		* A: Punch
		* B: Throw football
		* Hold B to wind up football and throw it further
	


=============
Known Bugs
=============
1. Occasionally the controllers don't initialize and thus it is necessary to unplug and re-plug the controllers
and run the program again. This error is likely due to the computer having difficultly recognizing the controllers.
2. Program will encounter a segmentation fault or memory dump upon exit of the program.
